## Usage

Here's how the app runs: 
A timer will start, then one question will display until you answer it or the time runs out.

If you select the correct answer, a congratulatory giphy will display. :tada:

After a few seconds, display the next question.
The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs, but without the enthusiasm.

If you run out of out of time, the correct answer will be displayed. After a few seconds, it'll show the next question.

On the final screen, you'll see how many correct answers you got, as well as incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game.

Sound like a great time? Well, get started!
